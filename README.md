# Story Generator Lab

## Description
This project is a JavaScript lab exercise that demonstrates how to manipulate data using variables. The program generates a "Mad Libs" style story using a specific sentence template. It outputs the story to the console, reassigns the variables with new words, and generates a second, unique story using the same template.

## Technologies Used
* **JavaScript**

## Key Concepts
* **Variable Declaration:** Using `let` to create variables for parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
* **String Interpolation:** Using Template Literals (backticks) to insert variables into strings dynamically.
* **Variable Reassignment:** Changing the values of existing variables to alter the program's output without changing the logic.
* **Console Output:** Using `console.log()` to display results.

## How to Run
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the file in a code editor (like VS Code).
3.  Run the script using Node.js in your terminal:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    *(Note: If your file is named something else, replace `index.js` with your filename)*

## Example Output
```text
First story: Once upon a time, there was a(n) fluffy cat who loved to eat fish. The cat lived in a box and had tiny nostrils that blew fire when it was purring.
Second story: Once upon a time, there was a(n) slimy frog who loved to eat flies. The frog lived in a swamp and had green nostrils that blew fire when it was hopping.
